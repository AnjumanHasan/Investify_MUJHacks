To create a platform where the persuasion of equity and capital benefits both aspiring entrepreneurs and investors.
India is a budding hub of businesses, all big and small. Though big businesses are thriving and scaling, there are several other businesses that are still fighting to find their place in the market, struggling to connect with investors and raise investments especially during the tough times of the pandemic.
Thousands of businesses shut down every year due to insufficient funds, inconsistency and lack of growth. On the other hand, several investors are constantly looking for investment opportunities in return of shares and profit.We bring to the table the collaboration of these two entities together.


Investify is an android based application that connects businesses to prospective investors. Through our unique and innovative idea, we are trying to build a platform to connect the gap between businesses and investors!
This is just Shark Tank, but in an app!

Here's what Investify offers:
* Small business owners can list their businesses and the required amount of funding along with equity share
* Big businesses or investors can match with the listed businesses and invest in them.
* Easy to use and efficent application
